# Golang

Since we are going to make multiple tests, we are going to use go WORK and go MODULES, if you are not familiar with these, I recommend you

to run the modules you can use, for example run the hello world module we created:

```bash
# To run the go file inside go module
go run examples/01-hello-world/main.go
# Run the module itself
go run hello-world
```


```bash
go run hello-world
hello world
Sometimes weâ€™ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.

go build hello-world.go

ls

hello-world    hello-world.go

We can then execute the built binary directly.

./hello-world

hello world
```
